	- 치어리더1: What?
	- 쉘던: You're a cheerleader, and by saying "Go Wolves," I'm initiating a conversation about something that interests you.
	- 치어리더1: Oh, are you one of those special ed kids?
	- 쉘던: My mom says I'm special.
	- 쉘던: Would you like to be friends?

	- 쉘던: Are you sure? What if I told you I admired your boldly-applied makeup?
	- 쉘던: Greetings from stall number one.
	- 쉘던: As much as I detest that odd-smelling cigarette, I do applaud your rule-breaking bravado.
	- 쉘던: My name is Sheldon. What's yours?
	- 쉘던: Hello, gentlemen.
	- 쉘던: Did you watch any sports programs over the weekend?
	- 쉘던: Or perhaps did some kissing with girls?

	- 미시: 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100

	- 쉘던: I'm reading it again.
	- 미시: How come?
	- 쉘던: I clearly missed something.
	- 쉘던: I couldn't find one person who wanted to be my friend.
	- 미시: Did you look at the card inside?
	- 쉘던: Why? That's just other people who checked out the book.
	- 미시: It's a list of losers like you who can't find a friend.
	- 쉘던: So?
	- 미시: So they're desperate, and you have their names.
	- 쉘던: That's brilliant.
	- 미시: Mm.
	- 쉘던: Now, how is it that you can't count?
	- 마리: So your father tells me you've been reading a new book?
	- 쉘던: I am. It's about how to make friends.
	- 마리: Is that something you're interested in?
	- 쉘던: Not really, but Missy told me it makes you sad that I don't have any.
	- 마리: Oh.
	- 마리: I got to sew that girl's mouth shut.
	- 마리: So how's it going?
	- 쉘던: Well, the principles in the book didn't work for me at all.
	- 쉘던: Although Dad does like being called George over and over again, so you might give that a try.
	- 마리: Baby, you don't have to go to any trouble for me.
	- 쉘던: But I like doing things for you.
	- 쉘던: You're a nice lady.
	- 마리: But if the book's not working...
	- 쉘던: It isn't.
	- 쉘던: But I realized if I find the other people who checked out the book, they'd be looking for friends, too.
	- 마리: That's really smart.
	- 쉘던: Missy thought of it.
	- 마리: You're kidding.
	- 쉘던: I'm as surprised as you are.
	- 쉘던: Excuse me, Ms. Ingram?
	- 잉그럼: Sheldon, it's recess.
	- 잉그럼: Go outside, see what it's like.
	- 쉘던: Are you by any chance Evelyn Ingram?
	- 잉그럼: Yes.
	- 쉘던: The same Evelyn Ingram who checked out this book?
	- 잉그럼: And why is that your business?
	- 쉘던:  I just assumed you were looking to make a friend.
	- 잉그럼: Oh. Well, that was a long time ago.
	- 잉그럼: I had just gotten out of a very difficult relationship
	- 쉘던: With a friend?
	- 잉그럼: Friend.
	- 잉그럼: Ha! I gave that man three years of my life and my innocence.
	- 쉘던: I don't know what that means.
	- 잉그럼: It means men are lying dogs only interested in one thing.
	- 쉘던: Well, that's not the dictionary definition.
	- 잉그럼: Mm-hmm.
	- 잉그럼: Always starts the same.
	- 잉그럼: A quick glance across the room, a casual hand on the shoulder, lunch at Stuckey's.
	- 잉그럼: Oh, yeah, it's all romance and flowers in the beginning...
	- 어른 쉘던: The list proved to be a double-edged sword.
	- 어른 쉘던: It turns out self-help books written in 1936 were only of interest to adults.
	- 잉그럼: You're like, "I'm here because I care. And by the way, your phone could make calls, too."
	- 잉그럼: Then tries to turn this whole thing around like it's all about you being needy, and you're like, "Yes, I have needs! That's what makes me human!"
	- 어른 쉘던: ADULT SHELDON: Emotionally troubled adults.
